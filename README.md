# ShopMate
#### (Made as proof of concept using React + Vite)
You can add an item to the shopping list by filling in the input fields and clicking add.
The item is then stored in a json-server which is basically just writing to a file that imitates a database.
CRUD operations is then being used to handle the data (items).
After adding an item to the list, you can then both delete and edit the individual items.

First time I tried experimenting with Modal boxes.
In this program the user gets prompted with a modal box when trying to add more than 10 of the same item to the list.
