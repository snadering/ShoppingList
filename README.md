# React + Vite

# Shopping List
## (Made as proof of concept)
You can add an item to the shopping list by filling in the input fields and clicking add.
The item is then stored in a json-server which is basically just writing to a file that imitates a database.
CRUD operations is then being used to handle the data (items).
After adding an item to the list, you can then both delete and edit the individual items.

## All styling is done using Tailwind.
